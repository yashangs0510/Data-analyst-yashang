2-	Descriptive Statistics:
my Business license data is collected and inserted into the Amazon S3 bucket 'cov-raw-mah'. Within the subdirectories, the data is stored by year, month, and week for retrieval in both CSV and JSON format
A dedicated security group `COV-VS-Mah` managed access rules, ensuring secure connectivity for compute instances during processing. IAM roles and access analyzers monitor data interactions. 
AWS Glue DataBrew was used to profile and clean the business license dataset. The job succeeded with 100% valid values and no missing data across 22 columns. A transformation recipe was applied and executed successfully, producing two clean outputs for analytics, ensuring high data quality and consistency for further processing.
